# SuperTanker2D
My own game created in C++ during 2nd semester PJATK studies.




-To launch the game either:
A) Download the release, unpack and execute the 'SuperTanker2D.exe' file inside 'bin64'.    
or
B) Compile the project on your own. Textures & Font paths are set to '../C++GameData/...' so unpacked 'C++GameData.zip' and 'cmake-build-debug.zip' should be aside source code files as directories. Compiled executable file should be in 'cmake-build-debug' folder.


NOTE !!! - game window size is FIXED. DO NOT change its dimensions. DO NOT maximize the window.
