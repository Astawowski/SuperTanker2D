# SuperTanker2D
My own game created in C++ during 2nd semester PJATK studies.




-To launch the game either:
A) Download the release, unpack and execute the 'SuperTanker2D.exe' file inside 'bin64'.    
or
B) Compile the project on your own. Unpacked 'C++GameData.zip' and 'cmake-build-debug.zip' should be aside source code files as directories. Compile your executable file to './cmake-build-debug'.


NOTE !!! - game window size is FIXED. DO NOT change its dimensions. DO NOT maximize the window.
